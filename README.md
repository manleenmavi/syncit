# SyncIt

SyncIt is a utility that enables synchronization of VLC content across multiple Windows devices, including both audio and video playback. The primary goal is to facilitate audio output from multiple sound devices, a feature not natively supported by Windows. With SyncIt, you can open the same media file on two different windows, disable video playback on one window, and select different audio output devices.

## Controller

SyncIt utilizes a remote control interface (RC) integrated with Java, employing sockets and basic I/O for controlling VLC playback.

## GUI Interface

SyncIt features a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) developed using JavaFX, making it easy to configure and control synchronized VLC playback.
